I partnered with [Daniel](http://danielmartinezvilla.com) to design and develop Carlo's website, working closely with him during the process. My contributions included initial sketches, user testing, front-end development, taking pictures of the sandwiches (and eating the said sandwiches).

### The Problem

Carlo's food cart would visit different breweries each week. As his schedule constantly rotates, he uses Facebook and Instagram to indicate his location and hours.

Other food truck operators have dedicated websites which show their updated schedules and menu. Carlo wanted to have a website that would show his upcoming locations, menu and his biography.

Peruvian Sandwich lovers have to scroll through their Facebook feeds to find where Carlo will be operating.

### Design Process

We conducted a competitive analysis of other food truck websites on the internet and gathered our findings to see what Carlo's site could improve on:

- Only some food truck websites were mobile-friendly and had a responsive layout.
- Food trucks with changing schedules use Google Calendar's web frame, which had a dated look.

After discussing our findings and recommendations, Carlo wanted to have:

- A built in schedule that links to his Google Calendar.
- A simple menu of his sandwiches, contact link and biography.

While sketching, I envisioned users would be curious to know where Carlo's food cart is in the next few days and what kinds of sandwiches he would have.

With a mobile first approach, we began brainstorming various versions of how the website would look like on paper. After rounds of brainstorming and discussion, we finalized our designs with a hi-fi mockup of how the site would look like.

> We decided to only show 2-3 upcoming events and conceal the rest because 80% of users would only begin searching for food carts a few days in advance or the day of.

After Carlo had given us the green light, we began developing his site using Bootstrap, Yeoman, SCSS and a little bit of JavaScript to get the calendar working.

### Results
The site is now currently live at [donluchosinseattle.com](http://donluchosinseattle.com) and is visited regularly by customers.

Daniel and I are continuously working with Carlo to update and redesign the site during our spare time.
