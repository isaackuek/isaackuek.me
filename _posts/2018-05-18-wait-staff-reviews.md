# Problem Space

---
Who is my user? Wait staff
What is their problem?
Need to get customer feedback to improve to secure new employment
No singular location to get feedback from customers since they can post anywhere

Who is my secondary user? Diners
What is their problem?
No time to leave restaurant reviews unless it's really good or really bad
Don't know the name of server to leave feedback

Problem space
Is this targeted to more personalized restaurant industries? Where the server usually announces their name?

Should the problem help separate reviews from food vs. wait staff?
*Pros:* Isolate the feedback

I had to understand the current landscape of wait staffs, the hiring process, and also how diners provide feedback to wait staffs. I began the project by interviewing wait staffs, diners, and also hiring managers at restaurants to understand their perceptions around customer feedback.

**Research questions for diners:**
- How often do you leave feedback for restaurants you visit?
- If given the choice to rate the restaurant & the wait staff, which would you choose?

**Research questions for servers:**
- In what ways do customers leave feedback for you, if any?
- When looking for new jobs, what information do you include in your application?
- What are your thoughts on getting feedback and reviews from customers you serve?
- How much does previous customer feedback (good ones primarily) influence your job application if any?

**Research questions for establishments:**
- What are the top 3 things your successful hires have?
- Where does a collection of positive customer feedback that an applicant has rank in your decision making process?


#### Key takeaways
- Diners usually leave reviews for establishments, but rarely include specifics about servers unless they've had excellent service.
- Diners usually review shortly after leaving the restaurant, unless the restaurant collects paper feedback forms.
- Diners prefer to leave reviews about the restaurant and food rather than the server.
- Wait staffs
- Wait staffs
- Hiring managers prioritize experience, previous establishments, and personal referrals when considering candidates
> "I usually call up their personal references and ask about their work ethic." - Jennifer, Saffron Grill

- Hiring managers would be open to considering positive customer feedback for servers:
> "It's nice to have another point of reference when evaluating wait staff. I think it's a lot more important in higher end restaurants though." - Jered, Le Petit Cochon

I also needed to understand the current landscape of reviewing servers and restaurants by means of a comparative analysis of the tools that diners I talked to use:

Yelp
Google Reviews
TripAdvisor (Foreign countries)


# Brainstorm and set project scope, assumptions, & success criteria

* Experience should consider integrating into diner management tools

Constraints:
Targeted to sit-down restaurants that have assigned wait staff

Assumptions:
Waitstaff and diners have mobile phones, albeit limited for waitstaff while on the job
Diners may or may not be given the waitstaff's name


# Interview users to validate and unpack pain points, understand current landscape, cross check against scope, assumptions and success criteria


Experience, previous establishments, referrals


# Explore customer journeys and pick one
