### Summary

Concur has to create a user interface to allow administrators to meet GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) requirements and set how long data can be retained. I spent the first 3 months mentoring a UX intern, Liz, co-leading the product design with her, facilitating design thinking sessions, and navigating complex requirement changes. After her internship concluded, I led the project through final designs and implementation.

### Challenges
This is the first time Concur has had to deal with GDPR, so everyone in the working team had to understand GDPR requirements and what features were needed.
How might we create an interface that allows administrators to confidently handle data retention and comply with GDPR requirements?

#### Process
The team had a vague understanding of the requirements, but had not defined an experience. I facilitated a design thinking workshop with the entire working team to understand the problem space, get the team to empathize with the target audience, and brainstorm potential solutions.

I led everyone to create an empathy map to help us understand our user, the administrator. This helped the team uncover the implicit requirements, such as the need to instill trust and certainty in the product. I conducted design system blueprint exercise where we identified all the touchpoints Concur would have with the administrator to help them narrow down the scope of what the administrator interface actually had to accomplish and phase out features incrementally. I then encouraged the team to sketch out their ideal solutions and present them.

I learnt that developers were crucial to have in this discussion because of the complexities that the intern and I did not foresee in the beginning.

### Plan
A large challenge in the planning phase was the ever changing product requirements as the working team started uncovering implementation challenges. While the UX intern began initial user flows based on the findings from the design thinking workshop, I kept track of the questions we had about the UI in a spreadsheet and would update that periodically based on our interactions with PMs and stakeholders. I started a comparative analysis to see how other companies were handling data retention needs.

Microsoft
Complex and well built out data retention capability for emails, what worked really well for them was their clear setup process

Google
Simple interface to retain data, provided helpful videos to help their customers understand GDPR, what worked really well for them was their plain English description

#### Aha moment

I pushed to simplify our language and description of features we used very complex terms for things. I learnt that comparable experiences simplified the language of their interfaces and did not heavily rely on exact GDPR terminology, but were compliant.

### Design
While our UX intern led the low and high fidelity wireframes, I gave constant feedback and brainstormed different ideas with her and gave her pointers on how to utilize our design system. The project had multiple shifts in the interface requirements and it began harder to progress in designs. Each design sync with our Product Owner brought in new or conflicting requirements. This caused the design pattern we used to segment our products to not work. We found out some products shared configuration settings, which did not allow us to individually control how long data can be stored for each product.

[DataRetention_OpenQuestions]
In order to keep track of these constant changes, we created a spreadsheet of all the open questions and decisions that we’ve agreed upon and socialized it with the team. It was immediately helpful for Liz and I because we could then design for the constants and keep designs flexible for the functionality that have not been finalized. After her internship concluded, I built upon her designs and created updated prototypes for the development team to begin building out.

### Development

During the development phase, I provided the team with high fidelity assets, CSS and edge cases to the prototype. I used InVision to illustrate the intended user flow for using the product. I proposed our simplified text recommendations to our legal and privacy team to ensure that we were compliant even though we used simple English.

### Results and Takeaways
The development team is actively building out the interface, with the simplified terminology propagated throughout the GDPR initiative into other side projects. Given more time, I would have liked to conduct usability tests of how successful will administrators be in setting up their data retention periods.

I underestimated the time commitment to provide guidance and mentor someone and would budget additional time in the future when mentoring another intern. I also learned the importance of setting context for design problems when talking with people unfamiliar with the project. When Liz joined our team, a handful of our meetings with the product team went into the minutia immediately, making it challenging for both of us to contribute to the conversation. I made it a point to always set the context before discussing or presenting design problems since this was a brand new project for her.
