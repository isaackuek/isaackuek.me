    <p>I partnered with <a href="http://danielmartinezvilla.com">Daniel</a> to design and develop Carlo’s website, working closely with him during the process. My contributions included initial sketches, user testing, front-end development, taking pictures of the sandwiches (and eating the said sandwiches).</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>Carlo’s food cart would visit different breweries each week. As his schedule constantly rotates, he uses Facebook and Instagram to indicate his location and hours.</p>

<p>Other food truck operators have dedicated websites which show their updated schedules and menu. Carlo wanted to have a website that would show his upcoming locations, menu and his biography.</p>

<p>Peruvian Sandwich lovers have to scroll through their Facebook feeds to find where Carlo will be operating.</p>

<h3 id="design-process">Design Process</h3>

<p>We conducted a competitive analysis of other food truck websites on the internet and gathered our findings to see what Carlo’s site could improve on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only some food truck websites were mobile-friendly and had a responsive layout.</li>
  <li>Food trucks with changing schedules use Google Calendar’s web frame, which had a dated look.</li>
</ul>

<p>After discussing our findings and recommendations, Carlo wanted to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A built in schedule that links to his Google Calendar.</li>
  <li>A simple menu of his sandwiches, contact link and biography.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/res/donLuchos/sketchesDonLuchos.jpg" alt="Initial Sketches" /></p>

<p>While sketching, I envisioned users would be curious to know where Carlo’s food cart is in the next few days and what kinds of sandwiches he would have.</p>

<p>With a mobile first approach, we began brainstorming various versions of how the website would look like on paper. After rounds of brainstorming and discussion, we finalized our designs with a hi-fi mockup of how the site would look like.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We decided to only show 2-3 upcoming events and conceal the rest because 80% of users would only begin searching for food carts a few days in advance or the day of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After Carlo had given us the green light, we began developing his site using Bootstrap, Yeoman, SCSS and a little bit of JavaScript to get the calendar working.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>The site is now currently live at <a href="http://donluchosinseattle.com">donluchosinseattle.com</a> and is visited regularly by customers.</p>

<p>Daniel and I are continuously working with Carlo to update and redesign the site during our spare time.</p>
