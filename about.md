I'm Isaac and I love a well prepared brunch on a lazy Sunday. The love for food slowly influenced me to study human-centered design and learn how to create experiences that are memorable and delightful.

I settled on pursuing my undergraduate degree in [Informatics][0] at the University of Washington, Seattle focused on [Human Computer Interaction][1] in the Spring of 2013.

While studying, I've interned as a User Researcher at Amazon and as a UX Designer at Medbridge, a medical tech startup in Seattle.
